## EMG stuff
A sequence for reference:
1. Determine the muscles of interest;
2. Find the sensor position and orientation: [SENIAM](http://www.seniam.org/) ; or just visual inspection/feel
3. Do the skin preparation:
	1. Shave the area with the razor. Remember to shave a large area if using the neonatal electrodes;
	2. Wipe with wet paper towel (water);
4. Mark the sensor position and orientation, and check the exoskeleton straps position. If overlapped, do adjustment;
5. Tape the area with medical tape, just to remove the dead skin;
6. Activate the EMG sensors, remember the numbers, and check if they are working in the EMGworks Acquisition program;
7. Place the EMG sensors and electrodes;
8. Secure the sensors, electrodes and wires with athletic tapes; 
9. Configure the sensors in the program:
	1. Drag the sensor to the muscle;
	2. Experiment workflow: Plot and Store
		1. Task specific: check the sensors, in options, select EMG and ACC channel, check RMS overlap;
		2.
