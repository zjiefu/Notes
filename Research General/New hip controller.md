- **Overall goal:** We want to find more intuitive way to design the controller, instead of just using randomly chosen basis functions.
- **Different approaches:** 
	- Using model identification tools like SINDy.
	- Incorporating biomechanics knowledges.
	- Using hierarchy way to choose and design basis functions (are we still looking for tri-functions?) 
- **Fundamental Question:** Is it possible to design biomimetic controller using only kinematics data, i.e., how important is the unmeasurable part of human proprioception in locomotion control?
- Now think about **the functions of hip** during locomotion: [[@pandyMuscleJointFunction2010]]
	- During stance: Body weight support, needs gravity compensation. This part is more like a spring, or nonlinear spring.
	- During stance (non-static): injecting positive energy for acceleration or upward motion. Can still use spring here, but may need some pure energy injection. Also, want to have something velocity-sensitive.
	- During swing: move leg forward to initial the next gait cycle. A spring should be enough, but also want to have something velocity-sensitive.
