### For Elderly Study
Most elderly reflects that they want to feel being braced during RD and SD. Not sure if we should decrease the negative power tapering part in the controller.
I won't expect much bracing during RD and SD since the controller is not designed for that, but for STS bracing might be useful?

#### For 30CST
They will need to fully stand up and fully sit down for this task. At least in the last session the subject didn't use a correct posture.

#### For interview
The subject mentioned that if he stands up too fast, he has to wait for a minute to recover (?) from it. Not sure if this applies to everyone but seems EL03 also had this issue.

#### Backup Plan A
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility when they are fatigued
##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Pre-fatigue:** in both bare/passive exoskeleton conditions, walk on the circuit at the baseline speed until they reach a certain RPE level;
3. **Test:** Turn on the exoskeleton (for bare nothing to do), walk on the circuit for three laps and test their time/speed
##### Primary outcome:
Time to finish the three laps in test part.
##### Issues:
This experiment design aims to test if the exoskeleton is helpful when subjects are fatigued. However, what we want to test (at least initial hypothesis) is that the exoskeleton can improve their performance (or mobility, or slow down their fatigue), which means it should assist at the very beginning.

#### Backup Plan B
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility performance and slow down the rate of fatigue
##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Test:** subjects walk on the circuit in both bare/active exoskeleton conditions until they are slower than their baseline speed (15% threshold) for three consecutive laps, which is called a failure.
3. ~~**Muscle test (optional):** Do 30CST~~
##### Primary outcome:
**Lap finished** before they slow down. Can also check the result of 30CST.
##### How this design address the issues we have:
1. **Same amount of effort:** subjects always walk at their baseline speed. Although may not be the same, it still a fair comparison? (This is based on the assumption that they can always finish the same number of laps, which is not validated)
2. **Different people may have different fitness level:** since it is not a fixed-time/distance experiment, it is purely based on subjects performance, i.e., when they slow down to a certain point.

### Some thoughts after parsing data
1. The lap time is highly variable for exoskeleton condition, but seems faster at the very end.
2. How should we interpret the baseline speed? We want to use the baseline speed for normalization to eliminate the day-to-day variance and maybe learning effect. However, with the exoskeleton seems like the subject walks slower. Count in total that's a lot (~ 20 sec), however, if we divide everything by lap this will only be <2 sec per lap.
3. Considering 2, it is possible for subjects to walk at ~ the same level of speed as the bare condition, which means backup plan B can be a good option.

### Thinking about how to use the baseline

So need to think about how to use the measured baseline for result correction. Currently we directly substract baseline from the result. However, this seem doesn't work (?)
- In baseline condition they only need to walk for two laps, which means they may walk faster comparing with a longer task.
- If they walk faster in baseline condition, they may fatigue faster, which leads to a slower speed in the test? (really?)
