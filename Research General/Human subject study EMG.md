## EMG Collection Checklist

1. Determine the muscles of interest;
2. Find the sensor position and orientation: [SENIAM](http://www.seniam.org/) ; or just visual inspection/feel
3. Do the skin preparation:
    1. Shave the area with the razor. Remember to shave a large area if using the neonatal electrodes;
    2. Wipe with wet paper towel (water);
4. Mark the sensor position and orientation, and check the exoskeleton straps position. If overlapped, do adjustment;
5. Tape the area with medical tape, just to remove the dead skin;
6. Activate the EMG sensors, remember the numbers, and check if they are working in the EMGworks Acquisition program;
7. Place the EMG sensors and electrodes;
8. Secure the sensors, electrodes and wires with athletic tapes;
9. Configure the sensors in the program:
    1. Drag the sensor to the muscle;
    2. Experiment workflow: Plot and Store
        1. **Task specific - Run time: set to 10-15 min**
        2. Task specific: check the sensors, in options, select EMG and ACC channel, check RMS overlap;
        3. General - Tigger inputs: check the "wait for a start trigger on: Trigno Wireless System (start trigger)", and the "Stop on trigger from: Trigno Wireless System (stop trigger)", if want to do external trigger;
10. Start collection;
11. Zoom the plot:
    1. Global options: check "link y-axis";
    2. Press F5 to zoom-in;
    3. Drag the slider at the bottom to the very right end;
12. Press "Start" button, and press Start trigger to start.
