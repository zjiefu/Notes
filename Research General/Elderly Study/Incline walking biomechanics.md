1. In sagittal plane, hip, knee and ankle are more flexed during incline walking.
2. At 5% (2.86 deg) the hip moment increased by 20%, but the knee moment even decreased. Also demonstrated that at 10% (5.7 deg) the hip moment is not actually significantly larger than 5% . However, this is something still need to be crosschecked with other papers.![[Pasted image 20240418181656.png]]

1. With increased slope, hip extension moment increases (sensible), but knee extension torque also decreases (doesn't make much sense).![[Pasted image 20240418183323.png]]
2. Metabolic cost increased 52+17% above level walking at 5% incline and increased 113+32% above level walking at 10% incline.

## Random things
1. Comparing with younger population, elderly people use their hip extensors more and their knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors less when walking at the same speed.
