#### Backup Plan B
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility performance and slow down the rate of fatigue
##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Test:** subjects walk on the circuit in both bare/active exoskeleton conditions until they are slower than their baseline speed (15% threshold) for three consecutive laps, which is called a failure.
3. ~~**Muscle test (optional):** Do 30CST~~
##### Primary outcome:
**Lap finished** before they slow down. Can also check the result of 30CST.
##### How this design address the issues we have:
1. **Same amount of effort:** subjects always walk at their baseline speed. Although may not be the same, it still a fair comparison? (This is based on the assumption that they can always finish the same number of laps, which is not validated)
2. **Different people may have different fitness level:** since it is not a fixed-time/distance experiment, it is purely based on subjects performance, i.e., when they slow down to a certain point.
