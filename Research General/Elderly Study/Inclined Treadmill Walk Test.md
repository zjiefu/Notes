## Where this comes from:
1. Hypothesis: the benefit of exoskeleton is very small, which is hard to find when fresh. Need to design a test that "amplifies" the benefits.
2. Most subjects provided positive feedback for RA task.
3. The hip module should be most helpful during RA (due to the optimization).
4. Want to find a task that is most efficient for the hip module, which means will have the most significant improvement.

## What this task should be like:
- Should be an endurance style test, to "amplify" the effect of exoskeleton. 
- Should be a shallow slope, since a steep slop(~15 deg) will also require more knee power (Need to find some evidence for this).
- Should not be too fast, but self-selected speed/comfortable speed will be too hard to reach "failure" (e.g., speed drop or RPE change, etc.)

## What need to done:
1. Need to find the lower-limb biomechanics of elderly (general) population during incline walking ,especially the relationship between hip and knee. Want to find the "optimal" slope that maximize the benefits of hip. **(Keywords: elderly, incline waking, kinematics, biomechanics, etc.)** [[Incline walking biomechanics]]
2. Need to think about the metric (or stop criteria), due to the drawbacks of hip exoskeleton:
	1. Uncomfortableness
	2. Heat
	**(Keywords: hip exoskeleton, hip orthosis, comfortableness, etc.)**
3. Need to fine tune the controller such that it works with a wide range of speed and gait style. **(Could be hard for a range of speed, could use dynamics gain for assistance, but need to test on more people)** 



## What we learned from the first three subjects:
1. Most of them have knee muscle atrophy, which makes specific tasks harder (EL04-STS, EL05-SA)
2. Theoretically speaking, hip module should be able to help most of these tasks. However, in reality with hip people slows down a little bit.
3. Not sure what caused this speed decrease, but my assumption is coordination.
4. Therefore, need to design some tests that do not require much coordination, i.e., more static tests.
5. The drawbacks of treadmill tasks is that it may not be sensitive enough.


## New design: inclined treadmill 6MWT

### Findings from other paper:
1. Treadmill 6MWT is a reliable test in young people and older people
2. Results from treadmill 6MWT and over round 6MWT are usually not interchangeable.
3. Should provide at least one practice, since people usually have better performance in the second test.
4. Need to check subject encouragement. 


### Instructions
Subjects were instructed to walk along a 30-m taped line on the fl oor with taped markers placed every 3 m. Subjects turned at each end of the course, resulting in an elliptical pattern. The subjects were allowed to stop if needed during the test, but were not allowed to sit. Stride length was calculated prior to the practice trial and was based on each subject’s height. The pedometer was adjusted according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Groups of six subjects were scattered along the 30-m course and performed the test at the same time. Subjects were instructed not to run. Subjects were informed that this was an individual test not a competition, and that each person was to do their individual best during the trial. Subjects were randomly told either to “walk as far as you can in 6 minutes” strictly following the ATS recommendations or “walk as fast as you can in 6 minutes” (without running).  14   A researcher acted as a counter and was assigned to each subject to record the number of laps a participant completed. At the end of 6 minutes, subjects were instructed to stop where they were. Both the linear distance and the distance from the pedometer were recorded for each subject. The RPE was also recorded. (See  Table 2  for distance measures.) 


### Things to be done:
1. Need to read papers and check the repeatability of test (i.e., how many tests do we need to do)
	1. Conclusion from [here](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/38/2/261.full.pdf): 6MWT affected by learning effect, and need to be repeated;
	2. Conclusion from [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611102914629?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=87c163b81afc2309): 6MWT (or 2MWT) is repeatable after a practice test (i.e., at second and third test)
2. Need to read papers to determine the details of the test, e.g., instructions, rest time between sections
	1. **Instructions:** The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk on this treadmill, and control your speed as preferred, as we've practiced before. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You are permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. You may hold against the handrails while resting, but resume walking as soon as you are able. Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but don’t run or jog. 
3. Need to draft a checklist/procedure for the test
4. Need to verify if the device is robust enough for the test
5. Need to add padding to the device
**1-3 should be done by today, should start working on 4,5 today, and should ideally be done by Wednesday.**
