## Where this comes from:
1. Hypothesis: the benefit of exoskeleton is very small, which is hard to find when fresh. Need to design a test that "amplifies" the benefits.
2. Most subjects provided positive feedback for RA task.
3. The hip module should be most helpful during RA (due to the optimization).
4. Want to find a task that is most efficient for the hip module, which means will have the most significant improvement.

## What this task should be like:
- Should be an endurance style test, to "amplify" the effect of exoskeleton. 
- Should be a shallow slope, since a steep slop(~15 deg) will also require more knee power (Need to find some evidence for this).
- Should not be too fast, but self-selected speed/comfortable speed will be too hard to reach "failure" (e.g., speed drop or RPE change, etc.)

## What need to done:
1. Need to find the lower-limb biomechanics of elderly (general) population during incline walking ,especially the relationship between hip and knee. Want to find the "optimal" slope that maximize the benefits of hip. **(Keywords: elderly, incline waking, kinematics, biomechanics, etc.)** [[Incline walking biomechanics]]
2. Need to think about the metric (or stop criteria), due to the drawbacks of hip exoskeleton:
	1. Uncomfortableness
	2. Heat
	**(Keywords: hip exoskeleton, hip orthosis, comfortableness, etc.)**
3. Need to fine tune the controller such that it works with a wide range of speed and gait style. **(Could be hard for a range of speed, could use dynamics gain for assistance, but need to test on more people)** 



## What we learned from the first three subjects:
1. Most of them have knee muscle atrophy, which makes specific tasks harder (EL04-STS, EL05-SA)
2. Theoretically speaking, hip module should be able to help most of these tasks. However, in reality with hip people slows down a little bit.
3. Not sure what caused this speed decrease, but my assumption is coordination.
4. Therefore, need to design some tests that do not require much coordination, i.e., more static tests.
5. The drawbacks of treadmill tasks is that it may not be sensitive enough.


## New design: inclined treadmill 6MWT

### Findings from other paper:
1. Treadmill 6MWT is a reliable test in young people and older people
2. Results from treadmill 6MWT and over round 6MWT are usually not interchangeable.
3. Should provide at least one practice, since people usually have better performance in the second test.
4. Need to check subject encouragement.
