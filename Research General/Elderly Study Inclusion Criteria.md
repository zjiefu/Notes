> Low body mass index (BMI) is well recognized to be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality; a BMI <23.5 in males and <22 in females is associated with an increased mortality risk.

> Sarcopenia has been defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength (or loss of lean body mass) that occurs with aging.
- Some sources also state that sarcopenia could be related to change in muscle composition and quality. (i.e., not solely muscle mass)

- Can include walking speed as some metric, e.g., how long they need to cover some distance. Won't be really accurate but still helps.

> Those with sarcopenia were older and had smaller body size compared with those without sarcopenia in each sex (all P<0.001). Those with sarcopenia were physically less active in each sex

- Calf size reduction? (calf circumference) [https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1532-5415.2003.51362.x]()

## Possible questions
1. Have you experienced involuntary weight loss in the last 12 months? (or since 65 yo?)
2. Have you noticed that your calf becomes small in the last 12 months? (or since 65 yo?)
3. How easy it is for you to open the caps of bottled water? (1 to 10)
