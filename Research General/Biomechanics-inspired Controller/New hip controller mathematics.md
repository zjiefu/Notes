### So what are the math stuff we need for the new controller?

1. $J_2$ terms should be skew-symmetric, and it is the only place that we can use velocity dependency. This could be tricky.
	1. We can always construct matrices in a way such that they satisfy some good properties.
2. Still looking for the integrable requirement: "must be integrable such that some Lagrangian systems exists." Might be beneficial to think about the definition of integrable.
	1. Hamiltonian network are not integrable, but somehow they used numerical methods to make it possible? 
	2. Should check these Hamiltonian network papers.
