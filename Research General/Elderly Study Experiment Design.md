### For Elderly Study
Most elderly reflects that they want to feel being braced during RD and SD. Not sure if we should decrease the negative power tapering part in the controller.
I won't expect much bracing during RD and SD since the controller is not designed for that, but for STS bracing might be useful?

#### For 30CST
They will need to fully stand up and fully sit down for this task. At least in the last session the subject didn't use a correct posture.

#### For interview
The subject mentioned that if he stands up too fast, he has to wait for a minute to recover (?) from it. Not sure if this applies to everyone but seems EL03 also had this issue.

#### Backup Plan A
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility when they are fatigued
##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Pre-fatigue:** in both bare/passive exoskeleton conditions, walk on the circuit at the baseline speed until they reach a certain RPE level;
3. **Test:** Turn on the exoskeleton (for bare nothing to do), walk on the circuit for three laps and test their time/speed
##### Issue:
This experiment design aims to test if the exoskeleton is helpful when subjects are fatigued. However, what we want to test (at least initial hypothesis) is that the exoskeleton can improve their performance (or mobility, or slow down their fatigue), which means it should assist at the very beginning.

#### Backup Plan B
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility performance and slow down the rate of fatigue

##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Test:** subjects walk on the circuit in both bare/active exoskeleton conditions until they are slower than
