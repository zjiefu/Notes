### For Elderly Study
Most elderly reflects that they want to feel being braced during RD and SD. Not sure if we should decrease the negative power tapering part in the controller.
I won't expect much bracing during RD and SD since the controller is not designed for that, but for STS bracing might be useful?

#### For 30CST
They will need to fully stand up and fully sit down for this task. At least in the last session the subject didn't use a correct posture.

#### For interview
The subject mentioned that if he stands up too fast, he has to wait for a minute to recover (?) from it. Not sure if this applies to everyone but seems EL03 also had this issue.
