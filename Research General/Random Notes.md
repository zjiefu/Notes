### New hip controller

- **Overall goal:** We want to find more intuitive way to design the controller, instead of just using randomly chosen basis functions.
- **Different approaches:** 
	- Using model identification tools like SINDy.
	- Incorporating biomechanics knowledges.
	- Using hierarchy way to choose and design basis functions (are we still looking for tri-functions?)
