## Three principles
1. Take notes in your own words
2. "Irreducible" ideas
3. Connect the idea to other knowledges

## Fleeting Notes (document level)
Something you thought of when reading
Two parts: the source (highlight point) and the context 

## Permanent Notes (higher level)
- A wrap up of what learned from the paper, like take away points?
- Link new idea to the knowledge base
