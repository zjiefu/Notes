### For Elderly Study
Most elderly reflects that they want to feel being braced during RD and SD. Not sure if we should decrease the negative power tapering part in the controller.
I won't expect much bracing during RD and SD since the controller is not designed for that, but for STS bracing might be useful?

#### For 30CST
They will need to fully stand up and fully sit down for this task. At least in the last session the subject didn't use a correct posture.

#### For interview
The subject mentioned that if he stands up too fast, he has to wait for a minute to recover (?) from it. Not sure if this applies to everyone but seems EL03 also had this issue.

#### Backup Plan A
##### Hypothesis to test:
Exoskeletons can improve elderly people's mobility when they are fatigued
##### Experiment design:
1. **Baseline:** test the baseline of walking speed (fast);
2. **Pre-fatigue:** in both bare/passive exoskeleton conditions, walk on the circuit at the baseline speed until they reach a certain RPE level;
3. **Test:** Turn on the exoskeleton (for bare nothing to do), walk on the circuit for three laps and test their time/speed
##### Primary outcome:
Time to finish the three laps in test part.
##### Issues:
This experiment design aims to test if the exoskeleton is helpful when subjects are fatigued. However, what we want to test (at least initial hypothesis) is that the exoskeleton can improve their performance (or mobility, or slow down their fatigue), which means it should assist at the very beginning.

### Some thoughts after parsing data
1. The lap time is highly variable for exoskeleton condition, but seems faster at the very end.
2. How should we interpret the baseline speed? We want to use the baseline speed for normalization to eliminate the day-to-day variance and maybe learning effect. However, with the exoskeleton seems like the subject walks slower. Count in total that's a lot (~ 20 sec), however, if we divide everything by lap this will only be <2 sec per lap.
3. Considering 2, it is possible for subjects to walk at ~ the same level of speed as the bare condition, which means backup plan B can be a good option.

### Thinking about how to use the baseline

So need to think about how to use the measured baseline for result correction. Currently we directly substract baseline from the result. However, this seem doesn't work (?)
- In baseline condition they only need to walk for two laps, which means they may walk faster comparing with a longer task.
- If they walk faster in baseline condition, they may fatigue faster, which leads to a slower speed in the test? (really?)

### Study instructions
- "We don't want you to speed up if you are excited about being close to the end of the session."

### Performance & endurance
So our hypothesis is that with the exoskeleton the subjects' rate of fatigue will be less (i.e., they will fatigue slower). We are trying to figure out how to evaluate the level of fatigue. 
- **Speed**: this is based on the assumption that subjects will walk slower when they are fatigued;
	- We are trying to figure out how to find the baseline 
- **Perceived exertion**: this is RPE, which can better reflects how subjects feels. However, it is too subjective;

### Some thoughts after the study 
So EL04 had to stop and rest multiple times in the bare mode. When rests, the lap time will be much longer, but after resting she will be faster.
So how should we set up the stop criteria? They can stop and rest, or they can slow down so they don't need to rest.

We can see that during baseline condition she walked pretty fast (which is the same for the first two laps of 15CR) However, she slowed down really quickly.

### Random thoughts after discussion and reading papers
1. It takes a long time to train subjects using exoskeletons. For now what we have is still not enough, should have more training (e.g., at least 10 mins continuously walking on the circuit with the exoskeleton powered on)
	1. However, need to make sure that the exoskeleton can work well for ~10 mins.
2. No protocol will be perfect, plan B sounds good, but may still have some issues. If we got some good results from the current protocol, better just stick to it. There is always some way to make a good story for it.
3. Will need to think about how to use the baseline time wisely. Simply substract it from the total time seems not good (not leading to good results and not totally make sense).
4. Need to think about what the primary outcome should be. Total time seems plausible but feel like it is not good enough. Maybe we can evaluate the rest time? But what if some subjects do not rest (like EL03?)
5. There is still many ways to explore the data we have. Just keep doing it and see what the result will be like. There will always be something to talk about.
6. Really need to think about if there is anyway to add some extra harness system to the hip exoskeleton.
