Therefore, we investigated the effects of using different prosthetic configurations on the metabolic cost and biomechanics of running. Five athletes with bilateral transtibial amputations each performed 15 trials on a force-measuring treadmill at 2.5 or 3.0 m/s. Athletes ran using each of 3 different prosthetic models (Freedom Innovations Catapult FX6, Össur Flex-Run, and Ottobock 1E90 Sprinter) with 5 combinations of stiffness categories (manufacturer’s recommended and ± 1) and heights (International Paralympic Committee’s maximum competition height and ± 2 cm) while we measured metabolic rates and ground reaction forces. Overall, prosthetic stiffness [fixed effect (β) = 0.036; P = 0.008] but not height (P ≥ 0.089) affected the net metabolic cost of transport; less stiff prostheses reduced metabolic cost.

Gait speed can be expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and of lesser height and lower extremity muscle strength.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"BOHANNON","given":"RICHARD W."}],"citation-key":"bohannonComfortableMaximumWalking1997","container-title":"Age and Ageing","DOI":"10.1093/ageing/26.1.15","ISSN":"0002-0729","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",1]]},"page":"15–19","title":"Comfortable and maximum walking speed of adults aged 20—79 years: Reference values and determinants","title-short":"Comfortable and maximum walking speed of adults aged 20—79 years","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

We found that the timing of muscle activation was accounted for by five basic temporal activation components during running as we previously found for walking.

The major difference between walking and running was that one temporal component, occurring during stance, was shifted to an earlier phase in the step cycle during running. These muscle activation differences between gaits did not simply depend on locomotion speed as shown by recordings during each gait over the same range of speeds (5–9 km/h).

Robotic hip exoskeletons are able to support ambulatory functions in elderly people and provide rehabilitation for the patients with gait impairments. They can also augment human performance during normal walking, loaded walking, and manual handling of heavy-duty tasks by providing assistive force/torque. In this article, a systematic review of robotic hip exoskeletons is presented, where biomechanics of the human hip joint, pathological gait pattern, and common approaches to the design of robotic hip exoskeletons are described. Finally, limitations of the available robotic hip exoskeletons and their possible future directions are discussed, which could serve a useful reference for the engineers and researchers to develop robotic hip exoskeletons with practical and plausible applications in geriatric orthopaedics.\nThe translational potential of this article\nThe past decade has witnessed a remarkable progress in research and development of robotic hip exoskeletons. Our aim is to summarize recent developments of robotic hip exoskeletons for the engineers, clinician scientists and rehabilitation personnel to develop efficient robotic hip exoskeletons for practical and plausible applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Zi","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Qiaosheng"}],"citation-key":"chenStateoftheartResearchRobotic2020","collection-title":"The Role of FEA and Other Imaging-based Assessment in Orthopaedics","container-title":"Journal of Orthopaedic Translation","container-title-short":"Journal of Orthopaedic Translation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jot.2019.09.006","ISSN":"2214-031X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"page":"4-13","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"State-of-the-art research in robotic hip exoskeletons: A general review","title-short":"State-of-the-art research in robotic hip exoskeletons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214031X19302104","volume":"20"},

This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a continuous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from 10 able-bodied subjects walking at 27 combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately fits the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on a range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user.

This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a continuous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from 10 able-bodied subjects walking at 27 combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately fits the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on a range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user. This model produces a smooth continuum of trajectories over task, an impossibility for finite-state control algorithms. Random sub-sampling validation indicates that basis modeling predicts untrained kinematics more accurately than linear interpolation.","author":[{"family":"Embry","given":"Kyle R."},{"family":"Villarreal","given":"Dario J."},{"family":"Macaluso","given":"Rebecca L."},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"embryModelingKinematicsHuman2018","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2879570","ISSN":"1558-0210","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"page":"2342–2350","title":"Modeling the Kinematics of Human Locomotion Over Continuously Varying Speeds and Inclines","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

This study ﬁlls these important voids by introducing innovative features to the policy iteration algorithm. We introduce ﬂexible policy iteration (FPI), which can ﬂexibly and organically integrate experience replay and supplemental values from prior experience into the RL controller. We show system-level performances, including convergence of the approximate value function, (sub)optimality of the solution, and stability of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the FPI via realistic simulations of the human–robot system. It is noted that the problem we face in this study may be difﬁcult to address by design methods based on classical control theory as it is nearly impossible to obtain a customized mathematical model of a human–robot system either online or ofﬂine.

The goal of this paper is to design and establish clinical feasibility of an ankle exoskeleton control strategy that instantly and appropriately adjusts assistance to the changing biomechanical demand during variable walking. To accomplish this goal, we developed a proportional joint-moment control strategy that prescribes assistance as a function of the instantaneous estimate of the ankle joint moment and conducted a laboratory-based feasibility study. Four individuals with neuromotor impairment and one unimpaired individual completed exoskeleton-assisted slow and fast gait transition tasks that involved gait initiation and changing walking speed. We found that the controller was effective in instantaneously prescribing exoskeleton assistance that was proportional to the ankle moment with less than 14% root-mean-square error, on average. We also performed a three-subject pilot investigation to determine the ability of the proportional joint-moment controller to improve walking economy. Evaluated in two individuals with cerebral palsy and one unimpaired individual, metabolic cost of transport improved 17–27% during treadmill and over-ground walking with proportional control compared with wearing the exoskeleton unassisted. These preliminary ﬁndings support the continued investigation of proportional joint-moment control for assisting individuals with neuromuscular disabilities during walking in real-world settings.

  {"id":"gordonHumanintheLoopOptimizationExoskeleton2022","abstract":"Many assistive robotic devices have been developed to augment or assist human locomotion. Despite advancements in design and control algorithms, this task remains challenging. Human walking strategies are unique and complex, and assistance strategies based on the dynamics of unassisted locomotion typically offer only modest reductions to the metabolic cost of walking. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) methodologies have been used to identify subject-specific assistive strategies, which offer significant improvements to energy savings. However, current implementations suffer from long measurement times, necessitating the use of low-dimensional control parameterizations, and possibly requiring multiday collection protocols to avoid subject fatigue. We present a HIL methodology, which optimizes the assistive torques provided by a powered hip exoskeleton. Using musculoskeletal modeling, we are able to evaluate simulated metabolic rate online. We applied our methodology to identify assistive torque profiles for seven subjects walking on a treadmill, and found greater reductions to metabolic cost when compared to generic or off-the-shelf controllers. In a secondary investigation, we directly compare simulated and measured metabolic rate for three subjects experiencing a range of assistance levels. The time investment required to identify assistance strategies via our protocol is significantly lower when compared to existing protocols relying on calorimetry. In the future, frameworks such as these could be used to enable shorter HIL protocols or exploit more complex control parameterizations for greater energy savings.","author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Daniel F.

  {"id":"greggGeometricControlMotion","abstract":"This thesis presents a hierarchical geometric control approach for fast and energetically efficient bipedal dynamic walking in three-dimensional (3-D) space to enable motion planning applications that have previously been limited to inefficient quasi-static walkers. In order to produce exponentially stable hybrid limit cycles, we exploit system energetics, symmetry, and passivity through the energy-shaping method of controlled geometric reduction . This decouples a subsystem corresponding to a lower-dimensional robot through a passivity-based feedback transformation of the system Lagrangian into a special form of controlled Lagrangian with broken symmetry, which corresponds to an equivalent closed-loop Hamiltonian system with upper-triangular form. The first control term reduces to mechanically-realizable passive feedback that establishes a functional momentum conservation law that controls the \"divided\" cyclic variables to set-points or periodic orbits. We then prove extensive symmetries in the class of open kinematic chains to present the multistage application of controlled reduction. A reduction-based control law is derived to construct straightahead and turning gaits for a 4-DOF and 5-DOF hipped biped in 3-D space, based on the existence of stable hybrid limit cycles in the sagittal plane-of-motion. Given such a set of asymptotically stable gait primitives, a dynamic walker can be controlled as a discrete-time switched system that sequentially composes gait primitives from step to step. We derive \"funneling\" rules by which a walking path that is a sequence of these gaits may be stably followed by the robot. The primitive set generates a tree exploring the action space for feasible walking paths, where each primitive corresponds to walking along a nominal arc of constant curvature. Therefore, dynamically stable motion planning for dynamic walkers reduces to a discrete search problem, which we demonstrate for 3-D compass-gait bipeds. After reflecting on several connections to human biomechanics, we propose extensions of this energy-shaping control paradigm to robot-assisted locomotor rehabilitation. This work aims to offer a systematic design methodology for assistive control strategies that are amenable to sequential composition for novel progressive training therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert De Moss"}],"citation-key":"greggGeometricControlMotion","event-place":"United States -- Illinois","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9781124638706","language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"146","publisher":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","publisher-place":"United States -- Illinois","source":"ProQuest","title":"Geometric control and motion planning for three-dimensional bipedal locomotion","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/868855969/abstract/70CF2601F1A846ECPQ/1"},

This challenge might be addressed by a unifying control model used by recent bipedal robots, in which virtual constraints deﬁne joint patterns as functions of a monotonic variable that continuously represents the gait cycle phase. In the ﬁrst application of virtual constraints to amputee locomotion, this paper derives exact and approximate control laws for a partial feedback linearization to enforce virtual constraints on a prosthetic leg. We then encode a human-inspired invariance property called effective shape into virtual constraints for the stance period. After simulating the robustness of the partial feedback linearization to clinically meaningful conditions, we experimentally implement this control strategy on a powered transfemoral leg.

It is important to understand what factors limit performance of the task in older people, so that effective remedial approaches can be developed. In this study, we quantified lower-extremity muscle strength and chair-rise biomechanics in 12 young and 26 healthy elderly women during chair rise at normal and fast speeds without use of the hands. We found that hip and knee extensor torques, vertical and horizontal momentum, and vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces increased in the same way with speed for all subjects. All subjects increased their speed from normal to fast trials, but the young subjects were able to rise more quickly in the fast trials. In the normal speed trials, elderly subjects generated more trunk flexion and horizontal momentum while still in contact with the chair. Muscle activity patterns were similar for all subjects except that the elderly activated the ankle extensors earlier than the young. Although the elderly subjects were much weaker relative to body weight than the young subjects (48.5±14.1%), they were able to generate sufficient torques to perform the task. However, age-related differences suggest that chair-rise biomechanics were affected by the reduction in muscle strength, and that strength training regimens, particularly for the hip musculature, may be important to maintain chair-rise ability in the elderly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gross","given":"M.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Haarnoja","given":"Tuomas"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Aurick"},{"family":"Abbeel","given":"Pieter"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Sergey"}],"citation-key":"haarnojaSoftActorCriticOffPolicy2018","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1801.01290","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,8]]},"number":"arXiv:1801.01290","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor","title-short":"Soft Actor-Critic","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290"},
  {"id":"hanSelectionMuscleActivityBasedCost2021","abstract":"Using “human-in-the-loop” (HIL) optimization can obtain suitable exoskeleton assistance patterns to improve walking economy. However, there are differences in these patterns under different gait conditions, and currently most HIL optimizations use metabolic cost, which requires long periods to be estimated for each control law, as the physiological objective to minimize. We aimed to construct a muscle-activity-based cost function and to ﬁnd the appropriate initial assistance patterns in HIL optimization of multi-gait ankle exoskeleton assistance. One healthy subject walked assisted by an ankle exoskeleton under nine gait conditions and each condition was the combination of different walking speeds, ground slopes and load weights. Ten assistance patterns were provided for the subject under each gait condition. Then we constructed a cost function based on surface electromyography signals of four lower leg muscles and select the muscle weight combination by using particle swarm optimization algorithm to compose the cost function with maximum differences between different assistance patterns. The mean weights of medial gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior activity under all gait conditions are 0.153, 0.104, 0.953 and 0.145, respectively. Then we veriﬁed the effectiveness of this cost function by optimization and validation experiments conducted on four subjects.

Our control arises from shaping the kinetic energy of a bipedal robot with actuators at the ankles only. While any kinetic energy shape may be imposed on a fully actuated robot, we show that underactuation restricts the achievable forms of the kinetic energy to those that solve a particular nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). The general method of Auckly et al. for solving this PDE is reviewed and specialized to the case of mechanical systems. We show that the original nonlinear PDE may be reduced to one algebraic equation and two linear PDEs that may be solved simultaneously to ﬁnd the set of achievable closed-loop kinetic energy shapes.

However, to use it, we must first understand its characteristics in the context of exoskeleton control. Here, we systematically measured the control preferences of individuals wearing bilateral ankle exoskeletons during walking. We investigated users’ repeatability identifying their preferences and how preference changes with walking speed, device exposure, and between individuals with different technical backgrounds. Twelve naive and 12 knowledgeable nondisabled participants identified their preferred assistance in repeated trials by simultaneously self-tuning the magnitude and timing of peak torque. They were blinded to the control parameters and relied solely on their perception of the assistance to guide their tuning. We found that participants’ preferences ranged from 7.9 to 19.4 newton-meters and 54.1 to 59.2 percent of the gait cycle. Across trials, participants repeatably identified their preferences with a mean standard deviation of 1.7 newton-meters and 1.5 percent of the gait cycle. Within a trial, participants converged on their preference in 105 seconds. As the experiment progressed, naive users preferred higher torque magnitude. At faster walking speeds, these individuals were more precise at identifying the magnitude of their preferred assistance. Knowledgeable users preferred higher torque than naive users. These results highlight that although preference is a dynamic quantity, individuals can reliably identify their preferences. This work motivates strategies for the control of lower limb exoskeletons in which individuals customize assistance according to their unique preferences and provides meaningful insight into how users interact with exoskeletons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ingraham","given":"K.

The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and the criterion-related and construct validity of a 30-s chair stand as a measure of lower body strength in adults over the age of 60 years. Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults (M age = 70.5 years) volunteered to participate in the study, which involved performing two 30-s chair-stand tests and two maximum leg-press tests, each conducted on separate days 2–5 days apart. Test-retest intraclass correlations of .84 for men and .92 for women, utilizing one-way analysis of variance procedures appropriate for a single trial, together with a nonsignificant change in scores from Day 1 testing to Day 2, indicate that the 30-s chair stand has good stability reliability. A moderately high correlation between chair-stand performance and maximum weight-adjusted leg-press performance for both men and women (r = .78 and .71, respectively) supports the criterion-related validity of the chair stand as a measure of lower body strength. Construct (or discriminant) validity of the chair stand was demonstrated by the test's ability to detect differences between various age and physical activity level groups. As expected, chair-stand performance decreased significantly across age groups in decades–from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s (p < .01) and was significantly lower for low-active participants than for high-active participants (p < .0001). It was concluded that the 30-s chair stand provides a reasonably reliable and valid indicator of lower body strength in generally active, community-dwelling older adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"C.

Objectives: To test the hypothesis that reduced hip extension range during walking, representing a limiting impairment of hip tightness, is a consistent dynamic finding that (1) occurs with increased age and (2) is exaggerated in elderly people who fall. Design: Using a 3-dimensional optoelectronic motion analysis system, we compared full sagittal plane kinematic (lower extremity joint motion, pelvic motion) data during walking between elderly and young adults and between elderly fallers and nonfallers. Comparisons were also performed between comfortable and fast walking speeds within each elderly group. Setting: A gait laboratory. Participants: Twenty-three healthy elderly subjects, 16 elderly fallers (otherwise healthy elderly subjects with a history of recurrent falls), and 30 healthy young adult subjects. Main Outcome Measures: All major peak joint angle and pelvic position values. Results: Peak hip extension was the only leg joint parameter measured during walking that was both significantly lower in elderly nonfallers and fallers than in young adult subjects and was even lower in elderly fallers compared with nonfallers (all p <.05). Peak hip extension ± standard deviation during comfortable walking speed averaged 20.4° ± 4.0° for young adults, 14.3° ± 4.4° for elderly nonfallers, and 11.1° ± 4.8° for elderly fallers.

Conclusion: An isolated and consistent reduction in hip extension during walking in the elderly, which is exaggerated in fallers, implies the presence of functionally significant hip tightness, which may limit walking performance. Overcoming hip tightness with specific stretching exercises is worthy of investigation as a simple intervention to improve walking performance and to prevent falls in the elderly. © 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kerrigan","given":"D.

Gait testing was conducted on 225 healthy male and female individuals aged 60–79 years who were able to walk and move on their own and, speciﬁcally, walk on a treadmill for one minute.

The different age groups and sex could be distinguished using the coefﬁcient of variance (CV) of the double support phase and gait asymmetry (GA) at the preferred speed, and CVs of stride length and stance phase at faster speed. The results indicated that the values of GV obtained from the test were used to determine the variation in gait characteristics of elderly individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Bohyun"},{"family":"Youm","given":"Changhong"},{"family":"Park","given":"Hwayoung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Myeounggon"},{"family":"Noh","given":"Byungjoo"}],"citation-key":"kimCharacteristicsGaitVariability2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph18094704","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,28]]},"language":"en","page":"4704","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characteristics of Gait Variability in the Elderly While Walking on a Treadmill with Gait Speed Variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/9/4704","volume":"18"},

The EX1, which functions as a wearable hip exoskeleton, was used. Physical function was assessed before and after exercise with the EX1. After completing exercise with the EX1, the usability and satisfaction questionnaires were evaluated. Gait speed, timed up and go test (TUG), and four square step test (FSST) showed statistically signiﬁcant improvements after exercise with the EX1 in both groups (p < 0.05). In the 6 min walking test (6MWT), a signiﬁcant increase was observed in the middle-aged group (p < 0.05). In the short physical performance battery (SPPB), there was a signiﬁcant improvement in the old-aged group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, positive results in usability and satisfaction were noticed in both groups.

  {"id":"kimReducingEnergyCost2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            As we age, humans see natural decreases in muscle force and power which leads to a slower, less efficient gait. Improving mobility for both healthy individuals and those with muscle impairments/weakness has been a goal for exoskeleton designers for decades. In this work, we discover that significant reductions in the energy cost required for walking can be achieved with almost 50% less mechanical power compared to the state of the art. This was achieved by leveraging human-in-the-loop optimization to understand the importance of individualized assistance for hip flexion, a relatively unexplored joint motion. Specifically, we show that a tethered hip flexion exosuit can reduce the metabolic rate of walking by up to 15.2 ± 2.6%, compared to locomotion with assistance turned off (equivalent to 14.8% reduction compared to not wearing the exosuit). This large metabolic reduction was achieved with surprisingly low assistance magnitudes (average of 89 N, ~ 24% of normal hip flexion torque). Furthermore, the ratio of metabolic reduction to the positive exosuit power delivered was 1.8 times higher than ratios previously found for hip extension and ankle plantarflexion. These findings motivated the design of a lightweight (2.31 kg) and portable hip flexion assisting exosuit, that demonstrated a 7.2 ± 2.9% metabolic reduction compared to walking without the exosuit. The high ratio of metabolic reduction to exosuit power measured in this study supports previous simulation findings and provides compelling evidence that hip flexion may be an efficient joint motion to target when considering how to create practical and lightweight wearable robots to support improved mobility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jinsoo"},{"family":"Quinlivan","given":"Brendan T."},{"family":"Deprey","given":"Lou-Ana"},{"family":"Arumukhom Revi","given":"Dheepak"},{"family":"Eckert-Erdheim","given":"Asa"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Orzel","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Conor J."}],"citation-key":"kimReducingEnergyCost2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-14784-9","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"language":"en","page":"11004","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reducing the energy cost of walking with low assistance levels through optimized hip flexion assistance from a soft exosuit","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14784-9","volume":"12"},

These so-called “primitives” are thus putatively presented as the building blocks composing large and diverse movement repertoires. Previous results validated the use of such bio-inspired primitives for assisting locomotion through wearable robots relying on a simple and modular framework. Various locomotion tasks such as walking and stairs ascending/descending can be assisted by delivering torque profiles that are composed from this limited set of primitives. This paper goes one step further and presents a framework for extracting such primitives while constraining them to be simple and monophasic. More precisely, these primitives are shaped by three parameters only: their peak, their width, and a potentially asymmetry factor de-correlating the duration of the rising and falling edges. The paper shows that five primitives extracted from walking and running data might be enough to reconstruct virtual muscle stimulations across a large range of leg muscles and locomotion tasks, and that releasing primitive asymmetry only brings a limited improvement in the signal reconstruction process. This paves the way towards a versatile and extremely computationally efficient framework for locomotion assistance through wearable robots.","author":[{"family":"Laloyaux","given":"Henri"},{"family":"Ronsse","given":"Renaud"}],"citation-key":"laloyauxExtractionSimpleMonophasic2019","container-title":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)","DOI":"10.1109/CBS46900.2019.9114458","event-title":"2019 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"page":"253-260","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Extraction of simple monophasic motor primitives towards bio-inspired locomotion assistance","type":"paper-conference"},

The present study introduces an assistance timing controller that regulates assistance timing such that peak joint velocity and peak assistance power are offset by a reference value for our hip-type exoskeleton. This is followed by measuring the manner in which various assistance timing references affect an important metric for performance, namely metabolic cost. The results indicate that net metabolic cost exhibits a concave up pattern with the most reduction of 21%, when compared to walking without the exoskeleton, at 0% assistance timing reference.

  {"id":"leeWearableHipAssist2017","abstract":"The aims of this paper were to investigate the effectiveness of a newly developed wearable hip assist robot, that uses an active assist algorithm to improve gait function, muscle effort, and cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency in elderly adults. Thirty elderly adults (15 males/ 15 females) participated in thispaper. The experimental protocol consisted of overground gait at comfortable speed under three different conditions: free gait without robot assistance, robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z), and full RAG. Under all conditions, muscle effort was analyzed using a 12-channel surface electromyography system. Spatio-temporal data were collected at 120 Hz using a 3-D motion capture system with six infrared cameras. Metabolic cost parameters were collected as oxygen consumption per unit (ml/min/kg) and aerobic energy expenditure (Kcal/min).

While the initial feasibility of automating the process of knee prosthesis control parameter tuning has been demonstrated in a principled way, the next critical issue is to improve tuning efﬁciency and speed it up for the human user, in clinic settings, while maintaining human safety. We, therefore, propose a policy iteration with constraint embedded (PICE) method as an innovative solution to the problem under the framework of reinforcement learning. Central to PICE is the use of a projected Bellman equation with a constraint of assuring positive semideﬁniteness of performance values during policy evaluation. Additionally, we developed both online and ofﬂine PICE implementations that provide additional ﬂexibility for the designer to fully utilize measurement data, either from on-policy or off-policy, to further improve PICE tuning efﬁciency. Our human subject testing showed that the PICE provided effective policies with signiﬁcantly reduced tuning time. For the ﬁrst time, we also experimentally evaluated and demonstrated the robustness of the deployed policies by applying them to different tasks and users. Putting it together, our new way of problem solving has been effective as PICE has demonstrated its potential toward truly automating the process of control parameter tuning for robotic knee prosthesis users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Minhan"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Si","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"}],"citation-key":"liExpeditedImpedanceTuning2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in achieving optimized control for each individual user in the ﬁeld of wearable robots. However, HIL optimization methods lack scalability for high-dimensional space, while RL has mostly focused on optimizing robot kinematic performance. Thus, we propose a novel hierarchical framework to personalize robotic knee prosthesis control and improve overall gait performance. Speciﬁcally, in this study the framework was implemented to simultaneously design target knee kinematics and tune 12 impedance control parameters for improved symmetry of propulsive impulse in walking. In our proposed framework, HIL optimization is used to identify an optimal target knee kinematics with respect to symmetry improvement, while RL is leveraged to yield an optimal policy for tuning impedance parameters in highdimensional space to match the kinematics target. The proposed framework was validated on human subjects, walking with our robotic knee prosthesis. The results showed that our design successfully shaped the target knee kinematics as well as conﬁgured 12 impedance control parameters to improve propulsive impulse symmetry of the human users. The knee kinematics that yielded best propulsion symmetry did not preserve the normative knee kinematics proﬁle observed in non-disabled individuals, suggesting that restoration of normative joint biomechanics in walking does not necessarily optimize the gait performance of human-prosthesis systems. This new framework for prosthesis control personalization may be extended to other wearable devices or different gait performance optimization goals in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Minhan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Si","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Stallrich","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"}],"citation-key":"liHierarchicalOptimizationControl2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

This controller is based on the time delayed, self-feedback known for stabilizing oscillatory systems under certain conditions. In this controller, there are no separate estimators for the gait phase nor the environment, yet the controller can be generalized to operate under various walking conditions (e.g., stair and ramp walking). We ﬁrst deﬁne a state variable representing the current leg’s movement with hip joint angles. A simple assistance control can be described in closedloop form with the delayed state feedback. By assigning the appropriate time-delay and self-feedback gain, we can generate assistive torques stably under the interaction between human and exoskeleton. The controller provides immediate and smooth assistance to user movement by reﬂecting the change of leg motion at every control period. The proposed joint-anglebased delayed-feedback assistance controller can operate under various walking speeds and environmental changes (e.g., stairs and ramps) without the need for additional sensors, computational processing, and parameter adjustment. Using a simple leg swing model, we perform a stability analysis under a simpliﬁed condition to provide insights into the effects of the time-delayed feedback in oscillatory systems. Then, we experimentally validate the efﬁcacy of the proposed assistance controller by measuring the metabolic energy expenditure for level treadmill walking.

Human-exoskeleton systems can be represented in the form of the Euler-Lagrange equations or, equivalently, the port-controlled Hamiltonian equations to design control laws that provide task-invariant assistance across a continuum of activities/environments by altering energetic properties of the human body. We previously introduced a port-controlled Hamiltonian framework that parameterizes the control law through basis functions related to gravitational and gyroscopic terms, which are optimized to fit normalized able-bodied joint torques across multiple walking gaits on different ground inclines. However, this approach did not have the flexibility to reproduce joint torques for a broader set of activities, including stair climbing and stand-to-sit, due to strict assumptions related to input-output passivity, which ensures the human remains in control of energy growth in the closed-loop dynamics. To provide biomimetic assistance across all primary activities of daily life, this paper generalizes this energy shaping framework by incorporating vertical ground reaction forces and global planar orientation into the basis set, while preserving passivity between the human joint torques and human joint velocities.

By an innovative design of human experiments and simulation study, respectively, we validated the effectiveness of two solution approaches to solving the inverse problem using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and inverse optimal control (IOC).

  {"id":"liuNewRoboticKnee2022","abstract":"Recent efforts in the design of intelligent controllers for conﬁguring robotic prostheses have demonstrated new possibilities in improving mobility and restoring locomotion for individuals with lower-limb disabilities. In these efforts, personalizing the controller of the robotic device is a crucial step in order to meet individual user’s needs and physical conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) based control designs are among some of the most promising approaches to achieving real-time, optimal adaptive tuning capability. However, such designs to date rely on subjectively determining human-robot walking performance measures, commonly in a quadratic form. To further automate the RL design for robotic knee control parameter tuning and potentially improve human-robot locomotion performance, this study introduces a new bilevel optimization method to objectively specify such control design performance measures via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which in turn, will be used in low level (forward) RL design of the impedance control parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel optimization approach with improved humanrobot walking performance using systematic OpenSim simulation studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Ruofan"},{"family":"Si","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He Helen"}],"citation-key":"liuNewRoboticKnee2022","container-title":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","container-title-short":"IEEE Robot.

These control methods aim to replicate normative joint kinematics but do not facilitate learning patient-speciﬁc kinematics. Trajectoryfree control methods for exoskeletons are required to promote user control over joint kinematics. Our prior work on potential energy shaping provides virtual body-weight support through a trajectory-free control law, but altering only the gravitational forces does not assist the subject in accelerating/decelerating the body forward. Kinetic energy is velocity dependent and thus shaping the kinetic energy in addition to potential energy can yield greater dynamical changes in closed loop. In this paper, we generalize our previous work to achieve underactuated total energy shaping of the human body through a lowerlimb exoskeleton. By shaping the fully-actuated part of the body’s mass matrix, we satisfy the matching condition for different contact phases and obtain trajectory-free control laws.

  {"id":"lvTrajectoryFreeControlLowerLimb2021","abstract":"Kinematic control approaches for exoskeletons replicate normative joint kinematics associated with one speciﬁc task and user at a time, which makes it difﬁcult to adjust to continuously-varying activities during gait training. These approaches also overly constrain individuals who have partial or full volitional control of their limbs, preventing these individuals from choosing their own preferred gait patterns. To address these issues, we proposed a matching framework for underactuated total energy shaping (i.e., shaping both the potential and kinetic energies) with human and environmental interaction to provide task-invariant, energetic assistance. In our prior work, we designed assistive strategies to compensate for lower-limb inertia in the actuated part of the mass matrix while leaving mass related terms unshaped. While these strategies have demonstrated potential gait beneﬁts, shaping mass related terms in addition to lower-limb inertia can produce greater beneﬁts as they are more dominant in determining human dynamics during locomotion. Moreover, previous deﬁnitions of closed-loop mass matrix with reduced inertial parameters cannot guarantee its positive deﬁniteness. Having a non-positive deﬁnite mass matrix in the closed loop can render chaotic behaviors such as unbounded exoskeleton torques that cause danger to human users. In this paper, we generalize our prior work to shape all inertial terms in the actuated part of the mass matrix while ensuring its positive deﬁniteness in the closed loop. In addition, given a positive-deﬁnite, closed-loop mass matrix, we prove passivity from human input to joint velocity and highlight two Lyapunov stability results based on common assumptions of human joint control policies. We then show beneﬁts of the proposed approach and its advantages over conventional exoskeleton control methods with simulations on a human-like model. We also show that the corresponding assistive torques closely match the human torques of an able-bodied subject.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lv","given":"Ge"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"lvTrajectoryFreeControlLowerLimb2021","container-title":"IEEE Access","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3094979","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"95427-95443","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Trajectory-Free Control of Lower-Limb Exoskeletons Through Underactuated Total Energy Shaping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9475042/","volume":"9"},

We sought to investigate the effect of simulated reduced gravity and walking speed on quasi-stiffness of the hip, knee, and ankle in overground walking. 12 participants walked at 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s in 1, 0.76, 0.54, and 0.31 gravity. We defined 11 delimiting points in stance phase (4 each for the ankle and hip, 3 for the knee) and calculated the quasi-stiffness for 4 phases for both the hip and ankle, and 2 phases for the knee. The R2 value quantified the suitability of the quasi-stiffness models. We found gravity level had a significant effect on 6 phases of quasi-stiffness, while speed significantly affected the quasi-stiffness in 5 phases. We concluded that the intrinsic muscle-tendon unit stiffness was the biggest determinant of quasi-stiffness. Speed had a significant effect on the R2 of all phases of quasi-stiffness. Slow walking (0.4 m/s) was the least accurately modelled walking speed. Our findings showed adaptions in gait strategy when relative power and strength of the joints were increased in low gravity, which has implications for prosthesis and exoskeleton design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"MacLean","given":"Mhairi K."},{"family":"Ferris","given":"Daniel P."}],"citation-key":"macleanEffectsSimulatedReduced2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0271927","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,9]]},"language":"en","page":"e0271927","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Effects of simulated reduced gravity and walking speed on ankle, knee, and hip quasi-stiffness in overground walking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271927","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"makiGaitChangesOlder1997","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a cohort of ambulatory older adults, whether spatial-temporal measures of foot placement during gait can predict the likelihood of future falls or whether these measures are more likely to be indicative of adaptations associated with pre-existing fear of falling. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Baseline gait measurements were performed in a gait and balance laboratory; subsequent history of falling was monitored prospectively for 1 year in two self-care facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen male and 61 female consecutive volunteers (mean age = 82, SD = 6) who were independent in activities of daily living and able to walk 10 m unaided. MEASUREMENTS: Spatial gait parameters were derived from digitized “footprints”; temporal parameters were derived using footswitches. A clinical activity-based gait assessment was also performed. The dependent variables were pre-existing fear of falling (reported at baseline) and future falling (experiencing one or more falls during the 1-year follow-up). MAIN RESULTS: Reduced stride length, reduced speed, increased double-support time, and poorer clinical gait scores were associated with fear but showed little evidence of an independent association with falling. Conversely, increased stride-to-stride variability in stride length, speed, and double-support was associated independently with falling but showed little evidence of relationship to fear. Increased stride width showed some evidence of association with both falling and fear. Stride-to-stride variability in speed was the single best independent predictor of falling. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in gait cited previously as risk factors for falling, i.e., decreased stride length and speed and prolonged double support, may in fact be stabilizing adaptations related to fear of falling. Stride-to-stride variability in the control of gait is an independent predictor of falling and may be a useful measure for identifying high-risk individuals and evaluating preventive interventions. Stride width may also be a useful outcome measure. Contrary to common expectation, a wider stride does not necessarily increase stability but instead seems to predict an increased likelihood of experiencing falls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Maki","given":"Brian E."}],"citation-key":"makiGaitChangesOlder1997","container-title":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1532-5415.1997.tb00946.x","ISSN":"1532-5415","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","license":"1997 The American Geriatrics Society","page":"313-320","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Gait Changes in Older Adults: Predictors of Falls or Indicators of Fear?","title-short":"Gait Changes in Older Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1997.tb00946.x","volume":"45"},

In this article, we develop a new methodology, Hybrid-Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics, which identifies separate nonlinear dynamical regimes, employs information theory to manage uncertainty and characterizes switching behaviour. Specifically, we use the nonlinear geometry of data collected from a complex system to construct a set of coordinates based on measurement data and augmented variables. Clustering the data in these measurement-based coordinates enables the identification of nonlinear hybrid systems. This methodology broadly empowers nonlinear system identification without constraining the data locally in time and has direct connections to hybrid systems theory. We demonstrate the success of this method on numerical examples including a mass–spring hopping model and an infectious disease model. Characterizing complex systems that switch between dynamic behaviours is integral to overcoming modern challenges such as eradication of infectious diseases, the design of efficient legged robots and the protection of cyber infrastructures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mangan","given":"N.

Electrogoniometer and simulated IMU data from sixteen participants walking on level ground, ramps and stairs were used to evaluate our approach when benchmarked against a fullyconnected neural network, a long short-term memory network, and a baseline method (i.e., using subject-average moment curves based on ambulation mode and gait phase). Additionally, the generalizability of our approach was evaluated by testing on ground slopes, stair heights, and gait transitions withheld during model training. The TCN outperformed the benchmark approaches on the hold-out data (p < 0.05), with an average RMSE of 0.131±0.018 Nm/kg and R2 of 0.880±0.030 during steady-state ambulation.

This formulation can, however, result in altered gait pattern of the human joint from the natural pattern, which is undesired. In this paper, we proposed a novel concept of HIL optimization of a hip exoskeleton. The optimization goal was to maintain the hip kinematics while providing optimal mechanical energy from the exoskeleton by modulating the admittance control. Policy iteration was used to optimize the switching time within the gait phase, at which a single parameter of the admittance controller was altered to provide assistance. The stiffness and equilibrium angle were considered as the two parameters for altering at the switching time, resulting in three possible modes of operation for the algorithm: (i) switching the equilibrium point, (ii) switching stiffness while equilibrium point is set at maximum extension and, (iii) maximum flexion. The optimization algorithm was found to converge for all three modes, with the equilibrium mode resulting in multiple solutions. Further analysis of power injected by the exoskeleton in the three modes showed that the first and third mode reduced human energetic exertion while the second mode increased human exertion. Implications of the results as well as the observed muscle activation patterns in response to assistance are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Nalam","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Xikai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Minhan"},{"family":"Si","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He Helen"}],"citation-key":"nalamAdmittanceControlBased2022","container-title":"2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811553","event-title":"2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"page":"6743-6749","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Admittance Control Based Human-in-the-Loop Optimization for Hip Exoskeleton Reduces Human Exertion during Walking","type":"paper-conference"},

Reductions in mean muscular effort and peak muscle activation were seen across the primary squat musculature (excluding biceps femoris), demonstrating the potential to reduce fatigue leading to poor lifting posture.

The primary intent of this clinical commentary is to review and discuss the current understanding of the specific actions of the hip muscles. Analysis of their actions is based primarily on the spatial orientation of the muscles relative to the axes of rotation at the hip. The discussion of muscle actions is organized according to the 3 cardinal planes of motion. Actions are considered from both femoral-on-pelvic and pelvic-on-femoral perspectives, with particular attention to the role of coactivation of trunk muscles. Additional attention is paid to the biomechanical variables that alter the effectiveness, force, and torque of a given muscle action. The role of certain muscles in generating compression force at the hip is also presented. Throughout the commentary, the kinesiology of the muscles of the hip are considered primarily from normal but also pathological perspectives, supplemented with several clinically relevant scenarios. This overview should serve as a foundation for understanding the assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal impairments that involve not only the hip, but also the adjacent low back and knee regions.

  {"id":"nunesEvaluationMotorPrimitiveBased2020","abstract":"In order to assist after-stroke individuals to rehabilitate their movements, research centers have developed lower limbs exoskeletons and control strategies for them. Robot-assisted therapy can help not only by providing support, accuracy, and precision while performing exercises, but also by being able to adapt to different patient needs, according to their impairments. As a consequence, different control strategies have been employed and evaluated, although with limited effectiveness. This work presents a bio-inspired controller, based on the concept of motor primitives. The proposed approach was evaluated on a lower limbs exoskeleton, in which the knee joint was driven by a series elastic actuator. First, to extract the motor primitives, the user torques were estimated by means of a generalized momentum-based disturbance observer combined with an extended Kalman filter. These data were provided to the control algorithm, which, at every swing phase, assisted the subject to perform the desired movement, based on the analysis of his previous step. Tests are performed in order to evaluate the controller performance for a subject walking actively, passively, and at a combination of these two conditions. Results suggest that the robot assistance is capable of compensating the motor primitive weight deficiency when the subject exerts less torque than expected. Furthermore, though only the knee joint was actuated, the motor primitive weights with respect to the hip joint were influenced by the robot torque applied at the knee. The robot also generated torque to compensate for eventual asynchronous movements of the subject, and adapted to a change in the gait characteristics within three to four steps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nunes","given":"Polyana F."},{"family":"Ostan","given":"Icaro"},{"family":"Siqueira","given":"Adriano A.

  {"id":"ortegaInterconnectionDampingAssignment2002","abstract":"Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized “shaping” only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the di erence between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL–PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models. ? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"Romeo"},{"family":"Schaft","given":"Arjan","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Maschke","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Escobar","given":"Gerardo"}],"citation-key":"ortegaInterconnectionDampingAssignment2002","container-title":"Automatica","container-title-short":"Automatica","DOI":"10.1016/S0005-1098(01)00278-3","ISSN":"00051098","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4]]},"language":"en","page":"585-596","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005109801002783","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"ortegaPuttingEnergyBack2001","abstract":"Energy is one of the fundamental concepts in science and engineering practice, where it is common to view dynamical systems as energy-transformation devices. This perspective is particularly useful in studying complex nonlinear systems by decomposing them into simpler subsystems that, upon interconnection, add up their energies to determine the full system's behavior. The action of a controller may also be understood in energy terms as another dynamical system. The control problem can then be recast as finding a dynamical system and an interconnection pattern such that the overall energy function takes the desired form. This energy-shaping approach is the essence of passivity-based control (PBC), a controller design technique that is very well known in mechanical systems. Our objectives in the article are threefold. First, to call attention to the fact that PBC does not rely on some particular structural properties of mechanical systems, but hinges on the more fundamental (and universal) property of energy balancing. Second, to identify the physical obstacles that hamper the use of standard PBC in applications other than mechanical systems. In particular, we show that standard PBC is stymied by the presence of unbounded energy dissipation, hence it is applicable only to systems that are stabilizable with passive controllers. Third, to revisit a PBC theory that has been developed to overcome the dissipation obstacle as well as to make the incorporation of process prior knowledge more systematic. These two important features allow us to design energy-based controllers for a wide range of physical systems.","author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"R."},{"family":"Van Der Schaft","given":"A.J."},{"family":"Mareels","given":"I."},{"family":"Maschke","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"ortegaPuttingEnergyBack2001","container-title":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","DOI":"10.1109/37.915398","ISSN":"1941-000X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",4]]},"page":"18-33","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Putting energy back in control","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"ortegaStabilizationClassUnderactuated2002","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the application of a new formulation of passivity-based control (PBC), known as interconnection and damping (IDA) assignment to the problem of stabilization of underactuated mechanical systems, which requires the modification of both the potential and the kinetic energies. Our main contribution is the characterization of a class of systems for which IDA-PBC yields a smooth asymptotically stabilizing controller with a guaranteed domain of attraction. The class is given in terms of solvability of certain partial differential equations. One important feature of IDA-PBC, stemming from its Hamiltonian (as opposed to the more classical Lagrangian) formulation, is that it provides new degrees of freedom for the solution of these equations. Using this additional freedom, we are able to show that the method of “controlled Lagrangians”—in its original formulation—may be viewed as a special case of our approach. As illustrations we design asymptotically stabilizing IDA-PBCs for the classical ball and beam system and a novel inertia wheel pendulum. For the former, we prove that for all initial conditions (except a set of zero measure) we drive the beam to the right orientation. Also, we define a domain of attraction for the zero equilibrium that ensures that the ball remains within the bar. For the inertia wheel, we prove that it is possible to swing up and balance the pendulum without switching between separately derived swing up and balance controllers and without measurement of velocities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"R."},{"family":"Spong","given":"M.W."},{"family":"Gomez-Estern","given":"F."},{"family":"Blankenstein","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"ortegaStabilizationClassUnderactuated2002","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Five muscles—the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vasti, soleus, and gastrocnemius—contribute most significantly to the accelerations of the center of mass in the vertical, fore-aft, and medio-lateral directions when humans walk and run at their preferred speeds. Humans choose to switch from a walk to a run at speeds near 2 m s−1 to enhance the biomechanical performance of the ankle plantarflexors and to improve coordination of the knee and ankle muscles during stance. Muscles that do not span a joint can contribute to the contact force transmitted by that joint and therefore affect its stability. In walking, for example, uniarticular muscles that cross the hip and ankle act to create the adduction moment at the knee, thereby contributing to the contact force present in the medial compartment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pandy","given":"Marcus G."},{"family":"Andriacchi","given":"Thomas P."}],"citation-key":"pandyMuscleJointFunction2010","container-title":"Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105259","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"401-433","PMID":"20617942","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Muscle and Joint Function in Human Locomotion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-070909-105259","volume":"12"},

We focus on control policies that are determined by solving an optimization problem that depends on the current state and some adjustable parameters. We refer to such policies as interpretable in the sense that each of the individual components can be directly understood by practitioners once the parameters are set, i.e., the objective function encodes the desired goal and the constraint functions enforce the rules of the system. We discuss how various commonly used control policies can be viewed in this manner such as the linear quadratic regulator, (nonlinear) model predictive control, and approximate dynamic programming. Traditionally, the parameters that appear in these control policies have been tuned by hand, expert knowledge, or simple trial-and-error experimentation, which can be time consuming and lead to suboptimal results in practice. To this end, we describe how the Bayesian optimization framework, which is a class of efficient derivative-free optimization methods for noisy functions, can be used to efficiently automate this process. In addition to reviewing relevant literature and demonstrating the effectiveness of these new methods on an illustrative example problem, we also offer perspectives on future research in this area.","author":[{"family":"Paulson","given":"Joel A."},{"family":"Sorourifar","given":"Farshud"},{"family":"Mesbah","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"paulsonTutorialDerivativeFreePolicy2023","container-title":"2023 American Control Conference (ACC)","DOI":"10.23919/ACC55779.2023.10156412","event-title":"2023 American Control Conference (ACC)","ISSN":"2378-5861","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"page":"1295-1306","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Tutorial on Derivative-Free Policy Learning Methods for Interpretable Controller Representations","type":"paper-conference"},

For example, we do not know the relative importance of training, how much is required, or what type is most effective; how people adapt with the device; or the relative benefits of customizing assistance. We conducted experiments in which naïve users learned to walk with ankle exoskeletons under one of three training regimens characterized by different levels of variation in device behavior. Assistance was also customized for one group. After moderate-variation training, the benefits of customized assistance were large; metabolic rate was reduced by 39% compared with walking with the exoskeleton turned off. Training contributed about half of this benefit and customization about one-quarter; a generic controller reduced energy cost by 10% before training and 31% afterward. Training required much more exposure than typical of exoskeleton studies, about 109 minutes of assisted walking. Type of training also had a strong effect; the low-variation group required twice as long as the moderate-variation group to become expert, and the high-variation group never acquired this level of expertise. Curiously, all users adapted in a way that resulted in less mechanical power from the exoskeleton as they gained expertise. Customizing assistance required less time than training for all parameters except peak torque magnitude, which grew slowly over the study, suggesting a longer time scale adaptation in the person. These results underscore the importance of training to the benefits of exoskeleton assistance and suggest the topic deserves more attention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Poggensee","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Steven H."}],"citation-key":"poggenseeHowAdaptationTraining2021","container-title":"Science Robotics","DOI":"10.1126/scirobotics.abf1078","issue":"58","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"page":"eabf1078","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"How adaptation, training, and customization contribute to benefits from exoskeleton assistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.abf1078","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"prasannaDataDrivenPersonalizedSymmetry2022","abstract":"People with unilateral transtibial amputation generally exhibit asymmetric gait, likely due to inadequate prosthetic ankle function. This results in compensatory behavior, leading to long-term musculoskeletal impairments (e.g., osteoarthritis in the joints of the intact limb). Powered prostheses can better emulate biological ankles, however, control methods are over-reliant on able-bodied data, require extensive amounts of tuning by experts, and cannot adapt to each user’s unique gait patterns. This work directly addresses all these limitations with a personalized and data-driven control strategy. Our controller uses a virtual setpoint trajectory within an impedance-inspired formula to adjust the dynamics of the robotic ankle-foot prosthesis as a function of gait phase. A single sensor measuring thigh motion is used to estimate the gait phase in real time. The virtual setpoint trajectory is modified via a data-driven iterative learning strategy aimed at optimizing ankle kinematic symmetry. The controller was experimentally evaluated on two people with transtibial amputation. The control scheme successfully increased ankle angle symmetry about the two limbs by 25.3% when compared to the passive condition. In addition, the symmetry controller significantly increased peak prosthetic ankle power output at push-off by 0.52 W/kg and significantly reduced biomechanical risk factors associated with osteoarthritis in the intact limb. This research demonstrates the benefits of personalized and data-driven symmetry controllers for robotic ankle-foot prostheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Prasanna","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Realmuto","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Rombokas","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Klute","given":"Glenn K."}],"citation-key":"prasannaDataDrivenPersonalizedSymmetry2022","DOI":"10.36227/techrxiv.20483946.v1","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,16]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Data-Driven and Personalized Symmetry Controller for Robotic Ankle-Foot Prostheses","type":"report","URL":"https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/A_Data-Driven_and_Personalized_Symmetry_Controller_for_Robotic_Ankle-Foot_Prostheses/20483946/1"},

  {"id":"rantanenPromotingMobilityOlder2013","abstract":"Out-of-home mobility is necessary for accessing commodities, making use of neighborhood facilities, and participation in meaningful social, cultural, and physical activities. Mobility also promotes healthy aging as it relates to the basic human need of physical movement. Mobility is typically assessed either with standardized performance-based tests or with self-reports of perceived difficulty in carrying out specific mobility tasks. Mobility declines with increasing age, and the most complex and demanding tasks are affected first. Sometimes people cope with declining functional capacity by making changes in their way or frequency of doing these tasks, thus avoiding facing manifest difficulties. From the physiological point of view, walking is an integrated result of the functioning of the musculoskeletal, cardio-respiratory, sensory and neural systems. Studies have shown that interventions aiming to increase muscle strength will also improve mobility. Physical activity counseling, an educational intervention aiming to increase physical activity, may also prevent mobility decline among older people. Sensory deficits, such as poor vision and hearing may increase the risk of mobility decline. Consequently, rehabilitation of sensory functions may prevent falls and decline in mobility. To promote mobility, it is not enough to target only individuals because environmental barriers to mobility may also accelerate mobility decline among older people. Communities need to promote the accessibility of physical environments while also trying to minimize negative or stereotypic attitudes toward the physical activity of older people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rantanen","given":"Taina"}],"citation-key":"rantanenPromotingMobilityOlder2013","container-title":"Journal of Preventive Medicine and Public Health","container-title-short":"J Prev Med Public Health","DOI":"10.3961/jpmph.2013.46.S.S50","ISSN":"1975-8375","issue":"Suppl 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1]]},"page":"S50-S54","PMCID":"PMC3567319","PMID":"23413006","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Promoting Mobility in Older People","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3567319/","volume":"46"},

The purpose of this study was to establish the joint moment and range of motion demands of stair ascent relative to maximum capabilities in elderly and young adults. Fifteen elderly (mean age 75 years) and 17 young adult (mean age 25 years) participants ascended a purpose-built 4-step staircase with force platforms embedded into the steps and kinematic data was acquired using motion capture. Maximum musculoskeletal capabilities were assessed using a dynamometer. This study showed for the first time that stair ascent approaches the joint moment limits at the ankle in both young and older participants (∼90%). One of the most important and novel findings of this study was that elderly people were only capable of meeting the high demands by adopting a number of alternative strategies not observed in young adults: (i) applying the joint moments differently than young adults across the knee and ankle, (ii) translocating energy from the knee to the ankle, thereby enhancing the ankle joint moment upon maximum demand and (iii) by enabling the plantarflexors to act over a more favourable portion of the moment–angle relation upon maximum ankle joint moment demand. The elderly displayed a more cautious strategy to optimize positional stability during stair ascent, by maintaining a smaller separation between the centre of mass and centre of pressure in the frontal plane. It seems that elderly people may meet the demands of unaided stair ascent by adopting a number of alternative strategies to compensate for their reduced musculoskeletal capabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeves","given":"N.

Generalizations can possibly be made to predict gait individuality in unobserved conditions. Methods: Kinematic individuality—how one person's joint angles differ from the group—is quantified for every subject, joint, ambulation mode (walking, running, stair ascent, and stair descent), and intramodal task (speed, incline) in an open-access dataset with 10 able-bodied subjects. Four N-way ANOVAs test how prediction methods affect the fit to experimental data between and within ambulation modes. We test whether walking individuality (measured at a single speed on level ground) carries across modes, or whether a mode-specific prediction (based on a single task for each mode) is significantly more effective. Results: Kinematic individualization improves fit across joint and task if we consider each mode separately. Across all modes, tasks, and joints, modal individualization improved the fit in 81% of trials, improving the fit on average by 4.3^\\circ across the gait cycle. This was statistically significant at all joints for walking and running, and half the joints for stair ascent/descent. Conclusions: For walking and running, kinematic individuality can be easily generalized within mode, but the trends are mixed on stairs depending on joint.","author":[{"family":"Reznick","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Welker","given":"Cara Gonzalez"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"reznickPredictingIndividualizedJoint2022","container-title":"IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology","DOI":"10.1109/OJEMB.2023.3234431","ISSN":"2644-1276","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"211-217","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Predicting Individualized Joint Kinematics Over Continuous Variations of Walking, Running, and Stair Climbing","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

Controlling the dynamics governing CoM motion is, therefore, critical for maintaining efficient and stable gait. However, how CoM dynamics change with ankle exoskeletons is unknown, and how to optimally model individual-specific CoM dynamics, especially in individuals with neurological injuries, remains a challenge. Here, we evaluated individual-specific changes in CoM dynamics in unimpaired adults and one individual with post-stroke hemiparesis while walking in shoes-only and with zero-stiffness and high-stiffness passive ankle exoskeletons. To identify optimal sets of physically interpretable mechanisms describing CoM dynamics, termed template signatures, we leveraged hybrid sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (Hybrid-SINDy), an equation-free data-driven method for inferring sparse hybrid dynamics from a library of candidate functional forms. In unimpaired adults, Hybrid-SINDy automatically identified spring-loaded inverted pendulum-like template signatures, which did not change with exoskeletons (p > 0.16), except for small changes in leg resting length (p < 0.001). Conversely, post-stroke paretic-leg rotary stiffness mechanisms increased by 37–50% with zero-stiffness exoskeletons. While unimpaired CoM dynamics appear robust to passive ankle exoskeletons, how neurological injuries alter exoskeleton impacts on CoM dynamics merits further investigation. Our findings support Hybrid-SINDy’s potential to discover mechanisms describing individual-specific CoM dynamics with assistive devices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Proctor","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Steele","given":"Katherine M."}],"citation-key":"rosenbergQuantifyingChangesIndividualspecific2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-50999-0","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1031","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Quantifying changes in individual-specific template-based representations of center-of-mass dynamics during walking with ankle exoskeletons using Hybrid-SINDy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50999-0","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"sawickiMechanicsEnergeticsLevel2008","abstract":"Robotic lower limb exoskeletons that can alter joint mechanical power output are novel tools for studying the relationship between the mechanics and energetics of human locomotion. We built pneumatically powered ankle exoskeletons controlled by the user’s own soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control) to determine whether mechanical assistance at the ankle joint could reduce the metabolic cost of level, steady-speed human walking. We hypothesized that subjects would reduce their net metabolic power in proportion to the average positive mechanical power delivered by the bilateral ankle exoskeletons. Nine healthy individuals completed three 30·min sessions walking at 1.25·m·s–1 while wearing the exoskeletons. Over the three sessions, subjects’ net metabolic energy expenditure during powered walking progressed from +7% to –10% of that during unpowered walking. With practice, subjects significantly reduced soleus muscle activity (by ~28% root mean square EMG, P<0.0001) and negative exoskeleton mechanical power (–0.09·W·kg–1 at the beginning of session 1 and –0.03·W·kg–1 at the end of session 3; P=0.005). Ankle joint kinematics returned to similar patterns to those observed during unpowered walking. At the end of the third session, the powered exoskeletons delivered ~63% of the average ankle joint positive mechanical power and ~22% of the total positive mechanical power generated by all of the joints summed (ankle, knee and hip) during unpowered walking. Decreases in total joint positive mechanical power due to powered ankle assistance (~22%) were not proportional to reductions in net metabolic power (~10%). The ‘apparent efficiency’ of the ankle joint muscle–tendon system during human walking (~0.61) was much greater than reported values of the ‘muscular efficiency’ of positive mechanical work for human muscle (~0.10–0.34). High ankle joint ‘apparent efficiency’ suggests that recoiling Achilles’ tendon contributes a significant amount of ankle joint positive power during the push-off phase of walking in humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Sawicki","given":"Gregory S."},{"family":"Ferris","given":"Daniel P."}],"citation-key":"sawickiMechanicsEnergeticsLevel2008","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.009241","ISSN":"1477-9145, 0022-0949","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1402-1413","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mechanics and energetics of level walking with powered ankle exoskeletons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/211/9/1402/18202/Mechanics-and-energetics-of-level-walking-with","volume":"211"},
  {"id":"schaalDynamicMovementPrimitives2006","abstract":"Given the continuous stream of movements that biological systems exhibit in their daily activities, an account for such versatility and creativity has to assume that movement sequences consist of segments, executed either in sequence or with partial or complete overlap. Therefore, a fundamental question that has pervaded research in motor control both in artificial and biological systems revolves around identifying movement primitives (a.k.a. units of actions, basis behaviors, motor schemas, etc.). What are the fundamental building blocks that are strung together, adapted to, and created for ever new behaviors? This paper summarizes results that led to the hypothesis of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP). DMPs are units of action that are formalized as stable nonlinear attractor systems. They are useful for autonomous robotics as they are highly flexible in creating complex rhythmic (e.g., locomotion) and discrete (e.g., a tennis swing) behaviors that can quickly be adapted to the inevitable perturbations of a dynamically changing, stochastic environment.

A recent finding that allows creating DMPs with the help of well-understood statistical learning methods has elevated DMPs from a more heuristic to a principled modeling approach. Theoretical insights, evaluations on a humanoid robot, and behavioral and brain imaging data will serve to outline the framework of DMPs for a general approach to motor control in robotics and biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaal","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"schaalDynamicMovementPrimitives2006","container-title":"Adaptive Motion of Animals and Machines","DOI":"10.1007/4-431-31381-8_23","editor":[{"family":"Kimura","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Tsuchiya","given":"Kazuo"},{"family":"Ishiguro","given":"Akio"},{"family":"Witte","given":"Hartmut"}],"event-place":"Tokyo","ISBN":"978-4-431-24164-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"261-280","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher-place":"Tokyo","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamic Movement Primitives -A Framework for Motor Control in Humans and Humanoid Robotics","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/4-431-31381-8_23"},

Yet, currently available biomechanics datasets focus on either highly consistent, continuous, and symmetric activities, such as walking and running, or only a single specific non-cyclic task. To capture a more holistic picture of lower limb movements in everyday life, we collected data from 12 participants performing 20 non-cyclic activities (e.g. sit-to-stand, jumping, squatting, lunging, cutting) as well as 11 cyclic activities (e.g. walking, running) while kinematics (motion capture and IMUs), kinetics (force plates), and electromyography (EMG) were collected.

Here, we introduce a novel semi-active hip exoskeleton concept and evaluate human walking performance across a range of parameters using a tethered robotic testbed. Methods: We emulated semi-active hip exoskeleton (exo) assistance by applying a virtual torsional spring with a fixed rotational stiffness and an equilibrium angle established in terminal swing phase (i.e., via pre-tension into stance). We performed a 2-D sweep of spring stiffness x equilibrium position parameters (30 combinations) across walking speed (1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m/s) and measured metabolic rate to identify device parameters for optimal metabolic benefit. Results: At each speed, optimal exoskeleton spring settings provided a ∼10% metabolic benefit compared to zero-impedance (ZI). Higher walking speeds required higher exoskeleton stiffness and lower equilibrium angle for maximal metabolic benefit. Optimal parameters tuned to each individual (user-dependent) provided significantly larger metabolic benefit than the average-best settings (user-independent) at all speeds except the fastest (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.098 at 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m/s, respectively). We found significant correlation between changes in user's muscle activity and changes in metabolic rate due to exoskeleton assistance, especially for muscles crossing the hip joint. Conclusion: A semi-active hip exoskeleton with spring-parameters personalized to each user could provide metabolic benefit across functional walking speeds. Minimizing muscle activity local to the exoskeleton is a promising approach for tuning assistance on-line on a user-dependent basis.","author":[{"family":"Shafer","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Powell","given":"Justine C."},{"family":"Young","given":"Aaron J."},{"family":"Sawicki","given":"Gregory S."}],"citation-key":"shaferEmulatorBasedOptimizationSemiActive2023","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TBME.2022.3188482","ISSN":"1558-2531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"page":"271-282","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Emulator-Based Optimization of a Semi-Active Hip Exoskeleton Concept: Sweeping Impedance Across Walking Speeds","title-short":"Emulator-Based Optimization of a Semi-Active Hip Exoskeleton Concept","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},

Here, we establish statistical models that can closely estimate the slope of linear fits to the moment-angle graph of the hip in this phase, termed as the quasi-stiffness of the hip. Employing an inverse dynamics analysis, we identify a series of parameters that can capture the nearly linear hip quasi-stiffnesses in the resilient loading phase. We then employ regression analysis on experimental moment-angle data of 216 gait trials across 26 human adults walking over a wide range of gait speeds (0.75–2.63 m/s) to obtain a set of general-form statistical models that estimate the hip quasi-stiffnesses using body weight and height, gait speed, and hip excursion. We show that the general-form models can closely estimate the hip quasi-stiffness in the extension (R2 = 92%) and flexion portions (R2 = 89%) of the resilient loading phase of the gait.

We perform experiments to select sensors, collect training data, and validate the Wearable System with new subjects and new conditions for walking, running, stair climbing, and biking. The Wearable System uses inertial measurement units worn on the shank and thigh as they distinguish lower-limb activity better than wrist or trunk kinematics and converge more quickly than physiological signals.

  {"id":"slootSelfpacedFixedSpeed2014","abstract":"Instrumented treadmills are increasingly used in gait research, although the imposed walking speed is suggested to affect gait performance. A feedback-controlled treadmill that allows subjects to walk at their preferred speed, i.e. functioning in a self-paced (SP) mode, might be an attractive alternative, but could disturb gait through accelerations of the belt. We compared SP with fixed speed (FS) treadmill walking, and also considered various feedback modes. Nineteen healthy subjects walked on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill. Spatio-temporal, kinematic and kinetic gait parameters were derived from both the average stride patterns and stride-to-stride variability. For 15 out of 70 parameters significant differences were found between SP and FS. These differences were smaller than 1cm, 1°, 0.2Nm and 0.2W/kg for respectively stride length and width, joint kinematics, moments and powers. Since this is well within the normal stride variability, these differences were not considered to be clinically relevant, indicating that SP walking is not notably affected by belt accelerations. The long-term components of walking speed variability increased during SP walking (43%, p<0.01), suggesting that SP allows for more natural stride variability. Differences between SP feedback modes were predominantly found in the timescales of walking speed variability, while the gait pattern was similar between modes. Overall, the lack of clinically significant differences in gait pattern suggests that SP walking is a suitable alternative to fixed speed treadmill walking in gait analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sloot","given":"L.

Exoskeletons can increase walking speed, but the mechanisms behind these changes and the upper limits on performance are unknown. Human-in-the-loop optimization is a technique for identifying exoskeleton characteristics that maximize the beneﬁts of assistance, which has been critical to achieving large improvements in energy economy. In this study, we used human-in-the-loop optimization to test whether large improvements in self-selected walking speed are possible through ankle exoskeleton assistance. Healthy participants (N = 10) were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed on a self-paced treadmill while wearing tethered ankle exoskeletons. An algorithm sequentially applied different patterns of exoskeleton torque and estimated the speedoptimal pattern, which was then evaluated in separate trials. With torque optimized for speed, participants walked 42% faster than in normal shoes (1.83 m s−1 vs. 1.31 m s−1; Tukey HSD, p = 4 × 10−8), with speed increases ranging from 6% to 91%. Participants walked faster with speedoptimized torque than with torque optimized for energy consumption (1.55 m s−1) or torque chosen to induce slow walking (1.18 m s−1). Gait characteristics with speedoptimized torque were highly variable across participants, and changes in metabolic cost of transport ranged from a 31% decrease to a 78% increase, with a decrease of 2% on average.

The assistance profile is formulated as a Gaussian function with a human state variable and can be updated online to adapt to different users. The proposed profile continuously self-adjusts along the movement of the user's leg, especially when users change their walking patterns. The proposed control system iteratively compensates for the force control lag and amplitude attenuation to enable precise tracking of the assistance profile during natural human walking.

Our approach is based on directly designing the Hamiltonian dynamics of the target closed-loop behavior, shaping the energy of the human and the robot. Relative to previous energy shaping controllers for assistive exoskeletons, we introduce ground reaction force and torque information into the target behavior deﬁnition, reformulate the kinematics so as to avoid explicit matching conditions due to under-actuation, and avoid the need to switch between swing and stance energy shapes. Our controller introduces new states into the target Hamiltonian energy that represent a virtual second leg that is connected to the physical leg using virtual springs. The impulse the human imparts to the physical leg is ampliﬁed and applied to the virtual leg, but the ground reaction force acts only on the physical leg. A state transformation allows the proposed control to be available using only encoders, an IMU, and ground reaction force sensors. We prove that this controller is stable and passive when acted on by the ground reaction force and demonstrate the controller’s strength amplifying behavior in a simulation. A linear analysis based on small signal assumptions allows us to explain the relationship between our tuning parameters and the frequency domain ampliﬁcation bandwidth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Gray Cortright"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"thomasEnergyShapingExoskeleton2021","container-title":"2021 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","DOI":"10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9682793","event-place":"Austin, TX, USA","event-title":"2021 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)","ISBN":"978-1-66543-659-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,14]]},"language":"en","page":"1419-1425","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Austin, TX, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Energy Shaping Exoskeleton Controller for Human Strength Amplification","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9682793/"},
  {"id":"thorGenericNeuralLocomotion2021","abstract":"In this article, we present a generic locomotion control framework for legged robots and a strategy for control policy optimization. The framework is based on neural control and black-box optimization. The neural control combines a central pattern generator (CPG) and a radial basis function (RBF) network to create a CPG-RBF network. The control network acts as a neural basis to produce arbitrary rhythmic trajectories for the joints of robots. The main features of the CPG-RBF network are: 1) it is generic since it can be applied to legged robots with different morphologies; 2) it has few control parameters, resulting in fast learning; 3) it is scalable, both in terms of policy/trajectory complexity and the number of legs that can be controlled using similar trajectories; 4) it does not rely heavily on sensory feedback to generate locomotion and is thus less prone to sensory faults; and 5) once trained, it is simple, minimal, and intuitive to use and analyze. These features will lead to an easy-to-use framework with fast convergence and the ability to encode complex locomotion control policies. In this work, we show that the framework can successfully be applied to three different simulated legged robots with varying morphologies and, even broken joints, to learn locomotion control policies. We also show that after learning, the control policies can also be successfully transferred to a real-world robot without any modifications. We, furthermore, show the scalability of the framework by implementing it as a central controller for all legs of a robot and as a decentralized controller for individual legs and leg pairs. By investigating the correlation between robot morphology and encoding type, we are able to present a strategy for control policy optimization. Finally, we show how sensory feedback can be integrated into the CPG-RBF network to enable online adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Thor","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Kulvicius","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Manoonpong","given":"Poramate"}],"citation-key":"thorGenericNeuralLocomotion2021","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3016523","ISSN":"2162-2388","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"page":"4013-4025","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Generic Neural Locomotion Control Framework for Legged Robots","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9174772/authors#authors","volume":"32"},

This paper aims at developing a novel data-driven solution framework based on reinforcement learning (RL), without first modeling the human-robot dynamics, to provide optimal and adaptive personalized torque assistance for reducing human efforts during walking. Our automatic personalization solution framework includes the assistive torque profile with two control timing parameters (peak and offset timings), the least square policy iteration (LSPI) for learning the parameter tuning policy, and a cost function based on a transferred work ratio. The proposed controller was successfully validated on a healthy human subject to assist unilateral hip extension in walking. The results showed that the optimal and adaptive RL controller as a new approach was feasible for tuning assistive torque profile of the hip exoskeleton that coordinated with human actions and reduced activation level of hip extensor muscle in human.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Tu","given":"Xikai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Minhan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Si","given":"Jennie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He Helen"}],"citation-key":"tuDataDrivenReinforcementLearning2021","container-title":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","DOI":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562062","event-place":"Xi'an, China","event-title":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","ISBN":"978-1-72819-077-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,30]]},"language":"en","page":"10610-10616","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Xi'an, China","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Solution Framework for Optimal and Adaptive Personalization of a Hip Exoskeleton","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9562062/"},

The success of the method relies on the possibility of solving two PDEs which identify the kinetic and potential energy functions that can be assigned to the closed loop. Particularly troublesome is the partial differential equation (PDE) associated to the kinetic energy which is nonlinear and inhomogeneous and the solution, that deﬁnes the desired inertia matrix, must be positive–deﬁnite. In this note, we prove that we can eliminate or simplify the forcing term in this PDE by modifying the target dynamics and introducing a change of coordinates in the original system. Furthermore, it is shown that, in the particular case of transformation to the Lagrangian coordinates, the possibility of simplifying the PDEs is determined by the interaction between the Coriolis and centrifugal forces and the actuation structure. The examples of pendulum on a cart and Furuta’s pendulum are used to illustrate the results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Viola","given":"G."},{"family":"Ortega","given":"R."},{"family":"Banavar","given":"R."},{"family":"Acosta","given":"J.

Our controller comprises two high level modes of sit/stand and walking, and we develop heuristic biomechanical rules to control transitions. We use a phase variable based on the user's thigh angle to parameterize both walking and sit/stand motions, and use variable impedance control during ground contact and position control during swing. We extend previous work on data-driven optimization of continuous impedance parameter functions to design the sit/stand control mode using able-bodied data. Experiments with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis used by a participant with above-knee amputation demonstrate promise in clinical outcomes, as well as trade-offs between our minimal-tuning approach and accommodation of user preferences. Specifically, our controller enabled the participant to complete the sit/stand task 20% faster and reduced average asymmetry by half compared to his everyday passive prosthesis. The controller also facilitated a timed up and go test involving sitting, standing, walking, and turning, with only a mild (10%) decrease in speed compared to the everyday prosthesis.

  {"id":"welkerImprovingSitStand2023","abstract":"Individuals using passive prostheses typically rely heavily on their biological limb to complete sitting and standing tasks, leading to slower completion times and increased rates of osteoarthritis and lower back pain. Powered prostheses can address these challenges, but have control methods that divide sit-stand transitions into discrete phases, limiting user synchronization across the motion and requiring long manual tuning times. This paper extends our preliminary work using a thigh-based phase variable to parameterize optimized data-driven impedance parameter trajectories for sitting, standing, and walking, with only two classification modes. We decouple the stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand equilibrium angles through a knee velocity-dependent scaling term, reducing the model fitting error by approximately half compared to our previous results. We then experimentally validate the controller with three individuals with above-knee amputation performing sitting and standing transitions to/from three different chair heights. We show that our controller implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis produced biomimetic joint mechanics, resulting in significantly reduced sit/stand loading symmetry and time to complete a 5x sit-to-stand task compared to participants' passive prostheses. Integration with a previously developed walking controller also allowed sit/walk transitions between different chair heights. The controller's biomimetic assistance may reduce the overreliance on the biological limb caused by inadequate passive prostheses, helping improve mobility for people with above-knee amputations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Welker","given":"Cara"},{"family":"Best","given":"T.

As a result, joint impedance settings are often customized manually and heuristically in clinics, which greatly hinder the wide use of these advanced medical devices. This simulation study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of ADP for automatic tuning of the twelve knee joint impedance parameters during a complete gait cycle to achieve balanced walking. Given that the accurate models of human walking dynamics are difficult to obtain, the model-free ADP control algorithms were considered. First, direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP) was applied to the control problem, and its performance was evaluated on OpenSim, an often-used dynamic walking simulator. For the comparison purposes, we selected another established ADP algorithm, the neural fitted Q with continuous action (NFQCA).

This problem is not easily solved by traditional control designs or the latest robotic technology. Reinforcement learning (RL) is naturally appealing. The recent, unprecedented success of AlphaZero demonstrated RL as a feasible, large-scale problem solver. However, the prosthesis-tuning problem is associated with several unaddressed issues such as that it does not have a known and stable model, the continuous states and controls of the problem may result in a curse of dimensionality, and the human-prosthesis system is constantly subject to measurement noise, environmental change and humanbody-caused variations. In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of direct heuristic dynamic programming, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach, to automatically tune the 12 robotic knee prosthesis parameters to meet individual human users’ needs. We tested the ADP-tuner on two subjects (one able-bodied subject and one amputee subject) walking at a ﬁxed speed on a treadmill. The ADP-tuner learned to reach target gait kinematics in an average of 300 gait cycles or 10 min of walking. We observed improved ADP tuning performance when we transferred a previously learned ADP controller to a new learning session with the same subject.

  {"id":"weyandFastestRunnerArtificial2009","abstract":"The recent competitive successes of a bilateral, transtibial amputee sprint runner who races with modern running prostheses has triggered an international controversy regarding the relative function provided by his artificial limbs. Here, we conducted three tests of functional similarity between this amputee sprinter and competitive male runners with intact limbs: the metabolic cost of running, sprinting endurance, and running mechanics. Metabolic and mechanical data, respectively, were acquired via indirect calorimetry and ground reaction force measurements during constant-speed, level treadmill running. First, we found that the mean gross metabolic cost of transport of our amputee sprint subject (174.9 ml O2·kg−1·km−1; speeds: 2.5–4.1 m/s) was only 3.8% lower than mean values for intact-limb elite distance runners and 6.7% lower than for subelite distance runners but 17% lower than for intact-limb 400-m specialists [210.6 (SD 13.2) ml O2·kg−1·km−1]. Second, the speeds that our amputee sprinter maintained for six all-out, constant-speed trials to failure (speeds: 6.6–10.8 m/s; durations: 2–90 s) were within 2.2 (SD 0.6)% of those predicted for intact-limb sprinters. Third, at sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 m/s, our amputee subject had longer foot-ground contact times [+14.7 (SD 4.2)%], shorter aerial [−26.4 (SD 9.9)%] and swing times [−15.2 (SD 6.9)%], and lower stance-averaged vertical forces [−19.3 (SD 3.1)%] than intact-limb sprinters [top speeds = 10.8 vs. 10.8 (SD 0.6) m/s].

  {"id":"yandellPhysicalInterfaceDynamics2017","abstract":"Background: Wearable assistive devices have demonstrated the potential to improve mobility outcomes for individuals with disabilities, and to augment healthy human performance; however, these benefits depend on how effectively power is transmitted from the device to the human user. Quantifying and understanding this power transmission is challenging due to complex human-device interface dynamics that occur as biological tissues and physical interface materials deform and displace under load, absorbing and returning power.\nMethods: Here we introduce a new methodology for quickly estimating interface power dynamics during movement tasks using common motion capture and force measurements, and then apply this method to quantify how a soft robotic ankle exosuit interacts with and transfers power to the human body during walking. We partition exosuit end-effector power (i.e., power output from the device) into power that augments ankle plantarflexion (termed augmentation power) vs. power that goes into deformation and motion of interface materials and underlying soft tissues (termed interface power).\nResults: We provide empirical evidence of how human-exosuit interfaces absorb and return energy, reshaping exosuit-to-human power flow and resulting in three key consequences: (i) During exosuit loading (as applied forces increased), about 55% of exosuit end-effector power was absorbed into the interfaces. (ii) However, during subsequent exosuit unloading (as applied forces decreased) most of the absorbed interface power was returned viscoelastically. Consequently, the majority (about 75%) of exosuit end-effector work over each stride contributed to augmenting ankle plantarflexion. (iii) Ankle augmentation power (and work) was delayed relative to exosuit end-effector power, due to these interface energy absorption and return dynamics.\nConclusions: Our findings elucidate the complexities of human-exosuit interface dynamics during transmission of power from assistive devices to the human body, and provide insight into improving the design and control of wearable robots. We conclude that in order to optimize the performance of wearable assistive devices it is important, throughout design and evaluation phases, to account for human-device interface dynamics that affect power transmission and thus human augmentation benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yandell","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"Quinlivan","given":"Brendan T."},{"family":"Popov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Conor"},{"family":"Zelik","given":"Karl E."}],"citation-key":"yandellPhysicalInterfaceDynamics2017","container-title":"Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation","container-title-short":"J NeuroEngineering Rehabil","DOI":"10.1186/s12984-017-0247-9","ISSN":"1743-0003","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"40","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Physical interface dynamics alter how robotic exosuits augment human movement: implications for optimizing wearable assistive devices","title-short":"Physical interface dynamics alter how robotic exosuits augment human movement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-017-0247-9","volume":"14"},

We then consider a simple one-dimensional hopping robot and show how energy shaping and regulation control can be used to generate and transition between nearly globally stable hopping limit cycles. The principles from this example are then applied on two canonical walking models, the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) and compass gait biped, to generate and transition between locomotive gaits. These examples show that piecewise jumps in control parameters can be used to achieve stable changes in desired gait characteristics dynamically/online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yeatman","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"yeatmanUsingEnergyShaping2021","container-title":"Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics","DOI":"10.1115/1.4051589","ISSN":"1555-1415, 1555-1423","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"091005","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using Energy Shaping and Regulation for Limit Cycle Stabilization, Generation, and Transition in Simple Locomotive Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computationalnonlinear/article/16/9/091005/1114086/Using-Energy-Shaping-and-Regulation-for-Limit","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"zhangAdmittanceShapingBasedAssistive2019","abstract":"This paper presents an admittance shapingbased assistive control for a series elastic actuator (SEA) driven robotic hip exoskeleton that can assist individuals with hip muscle weakness to restore normative mobility. The motivation for this paper is to develop a uniﬁed controller framework for designing an SEA-driven hip exoskeleton to assist walking and enhance gait stability. The controller design aims to modify the dynamic response of a coupled human-exoskeleton system, i.e., the relationship between the net muscle torque exerted by the human and the resulting angular motion, to ensure strong human-exoskeleton synergy to provide the effective assistance. This controller was preliminarily evaluated on a healthy subject walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.0 m/s. Results showed that the exoskeleton can effectively provide walking assistance to the human by reducing electromyography (EMG) activation and increasing agility during locomotion. Speciﬁcally, EMG was reduced 3.3%–38% when walking with the hip exoskeleton when compared to walking without wearing the hip exoskeleton. In addition, timing of the maximum hip ﬂexion angle increased by 10% (moved from 42% to 32% of gait cycle) when the controller had an inertia compensation of 60%. The faster onset of the maximum ﬂexion angle will allow the wearer to more quickly generate reactive steps when trying to avoid a fall. Future work will aim to apply the hip exoskeleton to persons having hip muscle weakness or other musculoskeletal impairment, to restore hip movement and enough hip force to walk normally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Minh"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"}],"citation-key":"zhangAdmittanceShapingBasedAssistive2019","container-title":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","container-title-short":"IEEE/ASME Trans.

For each user, though, a device will need to be adjusted for optimum effect, which can be time-consuming. Zhang\n              et al.\n              show that the human can be included in the optimization process, with real-time adaptation of an ankle exoskeleton (see the Perspective by Malcolm\n              et al.\n              ). By using indirect calorimetry to measure metabolic rates, the authors were able to adjust the torque provided by the device while users were walking, running, and carrying a load.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              1280\n              ; see also p.\n              1230\n            \n          , \n            An exoskeleton control system can optimize itself by measuring and minimizing human energy use during walking.\n          , \n            Exoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Juanjuan"},{"family":"Fiers","given":"Pieter"},{"family":"Witte","given":"Kirby A."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Rachel W."},{"family":"Poggensee","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Atkeson","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Steven H."}],"citation-key":"zhangHumanintheloopOptimizationExoskeleton2017","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aal5054","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6344","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1280-1284","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal5054","volume":"356"},

  {"id":"zhangOptimalEnergyShaping2022","abstract":"Task-dependent controllers widely used in exoskeletons track predefined trajectories, which overly constrain the volitional motion of individuals with remnant voluntary mobility. Energy shaping, on the other hand, provides task-invariant assistance by altering the human body's dynamic characteristics in the closed loop. While human-exoskeleton systems are often modeled using Euler-Lagrange equations, in our previous work we modeled the system as a port-controlled-Hamiltonian system, and a task-invariant controller was designed for a knee-ankle exoskeleton using interconnection-damping assignment passivity-based control. In this paper, we extend this framework to design a controller for a backdrivable hip exoskeleton to assist multiple tasks. A set of basis functions that contains information of kinematics is selected and corresponding coefficients are optimized, which allows the controller to provide torque that fits normative human torque for different activities of daily life. Human-subject experiments with two able-bodied subjects demonstrated the controller's capability to reduce muscle effort across different tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiefu"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Peddinti","given":"Vamsi"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"zhangOptimalEnergyShaping2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.03777","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Optimal Energy Shaping Control for a Backdrivable Hip Exoskeleton","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03777"},

The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compactness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ultimately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus backdrive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom Brushless DC motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actuator can produce at least 23.9 Nm peak torque and 12.78 Nm continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68 Nm backdrive torque during walking conditions. Ablebodied human subjects experiments (N=3) demonstrate reduced quadriceps activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The minimal transmission also produces negligible acoustic noise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Hanqi"},{"family":"Nesler","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Divekar","given":"Nikhil"},{"family":"Peddinti","given":"Vamsi"},{"family":"Gregg","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"zhuDesignPrinciplesCompact2021","container-title":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","container-title-short":"IEEE/ASME Trans.
